Welcome to my website! 


I'm a software engineer living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I'm particularly interested in distributed computing, the Jupyter project, and the indie web (hence this site!) I've been interested in computing ever since I can remember and I love learning new things. Most recently I've been building platforms for data analytics, data engineering and data science.
